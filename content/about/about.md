# About me

I'm a Frontend Developer at [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner-cloud.de/en) since 2020.
I got my education from an [apprenticeship](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/education/the-german-vocational-training-system/the-german-vocational-training-system_node.html) at [United Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Internet) / [1&1](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%261_Telecommunication) from 2017 to 2020. Before that I attendet German High School (Realschule).
At my day-to-day job I use mostly Angular, TypeScript, Jest, Karma, Storybook and Cypress. In me free time I'm working on more of less serious projects in Rust and JavaScript which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeF0x).

Privately, I'm a [car nut](https://instagram.com/tobs_i30n), so you'll naturally find me at car meets. Recently I discovered car photography in which I'm trying my best with my iPhone. Most of [my shots](https://linktr.ee/themightywhatever) turn out all right I think.
Apart from roaring engines, I love listening to Metal music and other rather niche genres like Witch House, Hardwave and the like. I have a [public Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/9qz2xtkur2fengfsdcq8dd907?si=68bac929aacb49e2) playlist with a whopping 12 likes, does this make me famous now?

Another big interest of mine is [video games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/justaf0x), even though I'm not spending even remotely as much time on it as in high school as my job and my other hobbies took over. Still, I love having great online nights with my friends in GTA Online, various survival games like ARK: Survival Evolved and Icarus, and doing tuning challenges in Forza Horizon 5.
I'm also one of the last 6 or so worldwide remaining active Teamspeak 3 users (remember Teamspeak 3?).

When I'm offline (which sadly is a rare occurrence), my small but slowly growing [vinyl collection](https://www.discogs.com/de/user/TheMightyWhatever/collection) is keeping me company, or I read. Stuff like H. P. Lovecraft and other cosmic and incomprehensible horror fascinates me. Reads about occultism and demonology (even though I don't believe in the supernatural, and I am an atheist) are also very interesting to me. 
This fascination led me to discovering [Satanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism) of which I think to be a genuinely good moral [system and compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Basic_tenets), even though I don't consider myself to be a Satanist.

Thanks for reading, here's your reward for coming this far:
