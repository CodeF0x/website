      <description>How I somewhat got around my shitty DSL download speeds Recently I reset my computer because it was unbearibly slow from time to time. I wiped all my harddrives and re-installed Windows 11. When I re-installed the first game from my Steam library, Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3 which clocks in at around 150 GB download size, it hit me: my internet sucks. With a measly 70 Mbps download, it would take me almost 5 hours to download the game and that is just one of the many games I wanted to install.</description>

      <description>How to remove the Statement / Theme Banners from YouTube After years of these super annoying YouTube banners, I hacked together a little script that removes them from the DOM upon finding one.&#xA;To run this, you need to install something like Tampermonkey (available for Firefox and Chrome) and create a new userscript with the following code:&#xA;// ==UserScript== // @name Fuck YouTube Theme banners // @namespace https://codef0x.dev // @version 1.</description>

      <description>Import Witcher 3 save games from GOG to Steam in Linux Proton I recently bought Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt on Steam and wanted to import my savegames from the GOG version. In Windows, that&amp;rsquo;s easy: install the Witcher 3 on Steam, boot it up and press continue; your savegames will be there, as they&amp;rsquo;re saved in Users\you\Documents\The Witcher 3 and both games use that location to store their savegames at.</description>

      <title>Fix Lagging Darksouls3 Linux</title>

      <description>The issue Dark Souls 3 can be pretty laggy when running with Proton on Linux. According to my FPS counter, it would run at a constant 60 FPS (it&amp;rsquo;s locked to 60 by the game), but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like 60 FPS at all. Sometimes I even had very noticable lag spikes.&#xA;The solution To fix this issue, create a file called dxvk.conf in the root directory of your Dark Souls 3 installation.</description>

      <description>Foreword If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can try my other fix for stuttering games under Linux Proton. Maybe that fixes it. If that didn&amp;rsquo;t fix it or you have an AMD GPU, keep on reading.&#xA;Editing ARK&amp;rsquo;s launch options via Steam Inside your Steam library, do the following:&#xA;right-click on ARK: Survival Evolved click on &amp;ldquo;Properties&amp;rdquo; paste RADV_PERFTEST=aco %COMMAND% in the input field below &amp;ldquo;Launch Options&amp;rdquo; close out the window with the x-button That should be it.</description>

      <title>Steam Proton Shader Cashing</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This only works for NVIDIA cards! When I first tried out Steam&amp;rsquo;s Proton support, I noticed that DOOM Eternal wasn&amp;rsquo;t running smooth at all. I would be at a constant 75 FPS according to my FPS counter, but I still experienced a lot of stutters / micro lags while playing.&#xA;How I fixed the stuttering issue create a directory for the games to cache their shaders, e. g. /home/you/Shaders declare the following environment variables: __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP and set it to 1 __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH and set it to the path of your earlier created shaders directory However, this only fixes it for your current session.</description>
