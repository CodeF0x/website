I&rsquo;m a Frontend Developer at Hetzner Cloud since 2020.
I got my education from an apprenticeship at United Internet / 1&amp;1 from 2017 to 2020. Before that I attendet German High School (Realschule).
At my day-to-day job I use mostly Angular, TypeScript, Jest, Karma, Storybook and Cypress. In me free time I&rsquo;m working on more of less serious projects in Rust and JavaScript which you can find on GitHub.
Privately, I&rsquo;m a car nut, so you&rsquo;ll naturally find me at car meets. Recently I discovered car photography in which I&rsquo;m trying my best with my iPhone. Most of my shots turn out all right I think.
Apart from roaring engines, I love listening to Metal music and other rather niche genres like Witch House, Hardwave and the like. I have a public Spotify playlist with a whopping 12 likes, does this make me famous now?">

<p>I&rsquo;m a Frontend Developer at <a href="https://hetzner-cloud.de/en">Hetzner Cloud</a> since 2020.
I got my education from an <a href="https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/education/the-german-vocational-training-system/the-german-vocational-training-system_node.html">apprenticeship</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Internet">United Internet</a> / <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%261_Telecommunication">1&amp;1</a> from 2017 to 2020. Before that I attendet German High School (Realschule).
At my day-to-day job I use mostly Angular, TypeScript, Jest, Karma, Storybook and Cypress. In me free time I&rsquo;m working on more of less serious projects in Rust and JavaScript which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/CodeF0x">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Privately, I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://instagram.com/tobs_i30n">car nut</a>, so you&rsquo;ll naturally find me at car meets. Recently I discovered car photography in which I&rsquo;m trying my best with my iPhone. Most of <a href="https://linktr.ee/themightywhatever">my shots</a> turn out all right I think.
Apart from roaring engines, I love listening to Metal music and other rather niche genres like Witch House, Hardwave and the like. I have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/9qz2xtkur2fengfsdcq8dd907?si=68bac929aacb49e2">public Spotify</a> playlist with a whopping 12 likes, does this make me famous now?</p>
<p>Another big interest of mine is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/justaf0x">video games</a>, even though I&rsquo;m not spending even remotely as much time on it as in high school as my job and my other hobbies took over. Still, I love having great online nights with my friends in GTA Online, various survival games like ARK: Survival Evolved and Icarus, and doing tuning challenges in Forza Horizon 5.
I&rsquo;m also one of the last 6 or so worldwide remaining active Teamspeak 3 users (remember Teamspeak 3?).</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m offline (which sadly is a rare occurrence), my small but slowly growing <a href="https://www.discogs.com/de/user/TheMightyWhatever/collection">vinyl collection</a> is keeping me company, or I read. Stuff like H. P. Lovecraft and other cosmic and incomprehensible horror fascinates me. Reads about occultism and demonology (even though I don&rsquo;t believe in the supernatural, and I am an atheist) are also very interesting to me.
This fascination led me to discovering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism">Satanism</a> of which I think to be a genuinely good moral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Basic_tenets">system and compass</a>, even though I don&rsquo;t consider myself to be a Satanist.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, here&rsquo;s your reward for coming this far:</p>
