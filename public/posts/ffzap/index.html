Some googling later I found that there&rsquo;s not really a good way to run multiple ffmpeg processes in parallel or even just do batch processing.</p>
<p>Everybody just provided batch and shell scripts. Having to copy &amp; paste and maybe also debug them, I wasn&rsquo;t really satisfied. Also, controlling the output as in filename, extension, directory structure etc. is in theory super easy, but requires to adjust the script everytime. And so the idea of ffzap was born. Initially called mtc (Multithreaded Transcoding CLI), I later decided upon ffzap to highlight the two most important aspects of my tool &ndash; using ffmpeg under the hood and zap as in fast or quick.</p>
<p>The tool is fairly simple &ndash; both in code and usage.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ ffzap -i <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;~/Videos/YouTube/**/*.mp4&#34;</span> -f <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;-vf &#34;</span>scale<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>1920:1080,fps<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>30<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34; -c:v libx265 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k&#34;</span> -o <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;~/Videos/encoded/{{dir}}/{{name}}.mkv&#34;</span> -t <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command takes all videos in all subfolders of <code>~/Videos</code> ending in .mp4, re-encodes them as H265 while changing the resolution to FullHD, the FPS to 30 and the audio to 128k while running 4 ffmpeg processes in parallel. It saves all videos to a (new) directory <code>~/Videos</code> and keeping the file structure and file name of the original folder / videos, but setting MKV as the container.</p>
